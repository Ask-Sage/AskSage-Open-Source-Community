```python
models = ['aws-bedrock-titan', 'llma3', 'claude2', 'claude-3-opus', 'claude-3-sonnet', 'claude-35-sonnet', 'cohere', 'mistral-large', 'gpt-gov', 'gpt4-gov', 'gpt', 'gpt4', 'gpt4-32k', 'gpt35-16k', 'gpt4-vision', 'gpt-4o', 'gpt-4o-mini', 'dall-e-2', 'dall-e-3', 'google-bison', 'google-gemini-pro', 'gpt-4o-gov', 'groq-70b', 'gpt-o1', 'gpt-o1-mini', 'xai-grok']
```

> <span style="color:yellow">More models can be added by the Ask Sage team that are specific to a user's needs. (additional costs may apply)</span>


**Note:** The models listed above are subject to change and more models may be added in the future. 

## How to access Ask Sage? 
There are two main ways to interact with Ask Sage:

1. **Ask Sage Platform** - The Ask Sage platform provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the models and tools available on the platform. Users can input text, files, code, or other data and receive generated output from the models.
2. **Ask Sage API** - The Ask Sage API allows users to interact with the models and tools available on the platform programmatically. Users can send requests to the API and receive responses in JSON format. This allows for more flexibility and customization in how users interact with the models.
   1. Must be a registered user and be a paid subscriber to access the API. 

## Ask Sage API 
The Ask Sage API provides a RESTful interface for interacting with the models available through the platform. Users can send requests to the API and receive responses in JSON format. The API is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing workflows. 

Overall, this repository will provide setup instructions, examples, and other resources as one begins to explore the capabilities of Generative AI and how it can be used in real-world scenarios.

### API Endpoints Overview

</center>

> In the Example section, we will provide examples of how to use these endpoints to interact with the Ask Sage API and generate text using the models available on the platform.

### Generating API Keys

Users can obtain an API key from the Ask Sage platform and use it to generate an access token. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate the user and grant access to the API endpoints. 


> Navigate to the menu options and select the 'Account & Tokens' option. 
<p align="center">
<img src="images/Menu_Bar_Access_Token.png" width="700" alt="Ask Sage Menu Option 'Account & Tokens">
</p>

> Scroll down to the 'API Keys' section and click on the 'Generate API Key' button.
> 
> Create a new API Key by selecting the 'Create a new API Key' button. Provide a unique name for the API Key and click on the 'Submit' button. 
> 
> The API Key will be generated and displayed on the screen. Copy the API Key and store it in a secure location.

### API Authentication Set Up 

There are three methods to which a user can authenticate with the Ask Sage Endpoints:

 <center> <img src="images/api-authentication-options.png" alt="Authentication Options" height="350" width="375"> </center>

 ----------------------------

 #### 1. Ask Sage Python API Client 

The API key and email can be used to authenticate the user and grant access via the Ask Sage Python Client. The API key and user email will be included in the request headers.

For example, the following code snippet demonstrates how to create an instance of the AskSageClient class and authenticate with the Ask Sage API using the API key and email:
 
```python

import json # Import the json module to work with JSON data
import requests # Import the requests library to send HTTP requests
from asksageclient import AskSageClient # Import the AskSageClient class from the asksageclient module

# Function to load credentials from a JSON file
def load_credentials(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename) as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError("The credentials file was not found.")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise ValueError("Failed to decode JSON from the credentials file.")

# Load the credentials
credentials = load_credentials('../../credentials.json')

# Extract the API key, and email from the credentials to be used in the API request
api_key = credentials['credentials']['api_key']
email = credentials['credentials']['Ask_sage_user_info']['username']

"""  
class AskSageClient(
    email: email, # The email address of the user
    api_key: api_key, # The API key for the Ask Sage API, which can be obtained from the Ask Sage website
    user_base_url: str = 'https://api.asksage.ai/user', # The base URL for the user API
    server_base_url: str = 'https://api.asksage.ai/server' # The base URL for the server API
)
"""

ask_sage_client = AskSageClient(email, api_key) # Create an instance of the AskSageClient class with the email and api_key 

```

Following this setup the user can now interact with the Ask Sage API using the AskSageClient object. 


#### 2. 24 Hour - Access Token

An access token is generated using the API key and email address with the endpoint '/get-token-with-api-key'. The access token is valid for 24 hours and can be used to authenticate requests to the Ask Sage API.

This is a more secure method of authentication as the access token is only valid for a limited time and must be regenerated periodically.

Here is a sample code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to obtain an access token using your email address and API key: 


```python
import requests

# Define the endpoint URL
url = "https://api.asksage.ai/user/get-token-with-api-key"

# Define the payload with the user's email and API key
payload = {
    "email": "your_email@your_domain.com",
    "api_key": "sdfsdfsfr23456789" # Your API key generated from the Ask Sage platform
}

# Set the headers, if required (e.g., Content-Type)
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    # raw response
    print(data)
    # Extract the access token only from the response
    access_token = data['response']['access_token']
    print(access_token)
```

The generated access token can be used to authenticate requests to the Ask Sage API for the next 24 hours. Here is an example of how to use the access token to authenticate a request to any of the Ask Sage API endpoints:

```python

import requests

# Define the access token obtained from the previous request - Note: You would want to store this securely and not hardcode it in your script/file.
access_token = "fghjkl4567890" # Replace with the actual access token

# Define the endpoint URL
url = "https://api.asksage.ai/user/get-user-logins"  # Replace with the actual base URL of the API

# Define the payload with the limit parameter
payload = {
    "limit": 1  # Replace with the desired limit (max is 100)
}

# Set the headers, including the Authorization header with the Bearer token
headers = {
    "x-access-tokens": access_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    print("User Logins:", data)
else:
    print(f"Failed to get user logins. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

#### 3. Static API Key
Instead of generating an access token every time you need to access the API, you can pass the static API key where the token is expected. This is not as secure as generating a 24 hour access token, but it is a valid option for some use cases.

> Note: The expected header variable is `x-access-tokens` and the value is the API key. There is no time limit on the API key, but it is recommended to regenerate it periodically for security reasons.

```python
import requests

# Define the access token obtained from the previous request - Note: You would want to store this securely and not hardcode it in your script/file.
access_token = api_key # 

# Define the endpoint URL
url = "https://api.asksage.ai/user/get-user-logins"  # Replace with the actual base URL of the API

# Define the payload with the limit parameter
payload = {
    "limit": 1  # Replace with the desired limit (max is 100)
}

# Set the headers, including the Authorization header with the Bearer token
headers = {
    "x-access-tokens": access_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    print("User Logins:", data)
else:
    print(f"Failed to get user logins. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

--------------------------------

### Examples 

These examples will be more focused on how one can interact with the Ask Sage API and what to expect in the response. Additionally, some mini projects will be created to demonstrate the capabilities of Generative AI and how it can be used in real-world scenarios. Although this repository is focused on the Ask Sage API, the examples will be general enough to be applied to other platforms that provide similar services but may have different endpoints or parameters.

Note: The examples at the moment are more focused on text-based models but will be expanded to the interaction of LLM's with other data types like images, audio, and video (multi-modal models). Going into those examples will lead to more complex projects and will require more resources and time to complete.

After installing packages from `requirements.txt`, you may need to restart your Jupyter kernel to use the updated packages. This ensures that the newly installed libraries are loaded correctly.
 
#### 0. AI Ethics 

‚úÖ Done ‚úÖ 

This is not really an example but more of a discussion on the ethical implications of using AI and how to mitigate any potential risks. We place a strong emphasis that a user needs to be well trained on how AI works, but also provide a clear understanding that what is generated through GenAI tools may not always be correct.

#### 3. Custom Dataset

üöß In Construction üöß 

For the most part, LLM models are trained on large datasets that contain a wide range of text from various sources and are not guaranteed to be relevant to the user's specific needs. However, on Ask Sage, users can create custom datasets that contain text that is relevant to their domain or use case and use it with methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the performance of the model. Thus, this example will cover how to create a custom dataset and use it with a LLM model to generate text that is more relevant to the user's needs. More detailed information will be provided within the example on how the model works/integrates with the dataset.

#### 4. Comparing LLM Models

üöß In Construction üöß 

The number of LLM models available in today is vast and will continue to grow as more research is done in the field of generative AI. This example will cover how to compare different LLM models using Ask Sage agnostic API method, and evaluate their performance based on various criteria such as text quality, coherence, creativity, and more. Users can use this information to select the best model for their needs and make informed decisions about which model to use in their projects.

#### 5. Diagram Creation With LLMs

üöß In Construction üöß 

This is a unique project and will probably be outdated in the future but, LLMs are text-based models that generate text based on the input provided by the user, but what if we wanted to generate a diagram without having to manually create it? For example let's say we wanted a flowchart, mind map, Gantt chart, or any other type of diagram. This example will cover how we use mermaid.js a text-based diagram creation tool to generate diagrams based on the text generated by the LLM model.

#### 7. LLM Evaluation and Monitoring Dashboard

üöß In Construction üöß 

How do we evaluate the performance of a LLM model and monitor its progress over time? This example will cover how to create a dashboard that displays key metrics and insights about the LLM model. Users can use this dashboard to track the performance of the model and make informed decisions about how to improve it over time.

But first, we will use @arize-ai phoenix open source tool to create a dashboard that displays key metrics and insights about the LLM model.

#### 8. LLM Chatbot Network
üöß In Construction üöß 

Let's create a network of chatbots that can communicate with each other and generate text based on each other's output. This example will cover how to create a chatbot network using LLM models and simulate a conversation between the chatbots. Users can use this network to generate creative and engaging text that can be used in a variety of applications, scenarios, and modeling use cases.

## Requested Features or Enhancements to Ask Sage API
Here are some features or enhancements that we would like to see added to the Ask Sage API: 

Each item will have a link to the example that will be created to demonstrate where the feature or enhancement can be used.

### Issues
- Uploading data works and one is able to get a 'successful' response but only .docx and .pdf files are actually being processed and visible on the platform. [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
- When utilizing the query endpoint, the model parameter should not work if the model entered does not exist. Currently, any text can be entered and the API will return a response using the default model. [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
- When selecting a persona, the API should return an error if the persona entered does not exist. Currently, any text can be entered and the API will return a response using the default persona. This can be problematic if a user misspells the persona name, a persona is removed and if the user enters a persona that is not available or does not exist. [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
- When utilizing the train endpoint, the instruction mention to use the following format: user_content_USERID_DATASET-NAME_content. However, the dataset is not being recognized when using the format provided. Just used the dataset name and it worked. [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
  - Also would the uploaded content be visible on the platform? At the moment it is not visible.

### Enhancements
- For the /get_user_logs endpoint, add a parameter to specify the number of logs to return if a user wants to only get a specific number of logs. Additionally, can add a parameter to specify ascending or descending order of the logs. (Maybe a date filter parameter) [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
- An endpoint that allows to select a database that a user created and then see all the content that was added to the database and being able to delete it. [API Endpoints](examples/ex_1_api_endpoints)
