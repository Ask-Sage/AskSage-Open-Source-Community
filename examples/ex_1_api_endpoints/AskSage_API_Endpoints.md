## API Endpoints Overview

The Ask Sage API is documented using Swagger, which provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication methods.

### User API:
- Documentation: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NICOLASCHAILLAN_1/user-api/1.0
- The Base URL for the User API is: [ Base URL: https://api.asksage.ai/user/]

> The following table shows the available endpoints in the User API:

<center>

| Endpoint | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| /get-token-with-api-key | Get an access token with API Key and email |
| /get-user-logins | Get your last logins (limited to 5 by default) |
| /get-user-logs | Get your last prompts |
| /add-dataset| Add a new dataset |
| /delete-datasets| Deletes a dataset |
</center>

Append the Base URL with the endpoint to interact with the Ask Sage API. Example https://api.asksage.ai/user/add-dataset

### Server API: 
- Documentation: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/NICOLASCHAILLAN_1/server_ask-sage_api/1.0
- The Base URL for the Server API is: [ Base URL: https://api.asksage.ai/server/]

This information is used to interact with the Ask Sage API. The user can query models, select/get personas, get datasets, train models and more. 

> The following table shows the available endpoints in the Server API:

<center>

| Endpoint | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| /get-models | Returns a list of available models via the Ask Sage services |
| /query | Main endpoint for generating completions based on the user's input |
| /query_with_file | Query with file endpoint for generating completions based on the user's input |
| /follow_up_questions | Endpoint for generating follow-up questions based on the user's input |
| /tokenizer | Endpoint for getting tokens of string value |
| /get-personas | Endpoint for getting the tokens of string | 
| /get-datasets | Returns a list of available datasets |
| /get-plugins | Returns a list of available plugins |
| /get-train | Trains the model based on the user's input |
| /file | Converts a supported file to plain/text |
