    "<b> Ask Sage Tokens Overview </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask Sage tokens are the primary means of accessing the Ask Sage platform and function as its currency. In the context of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), a token represents a unit of text that the model processes. Tokens can vary in length, ranging from a single character to an entire word, depending on the language and the model's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Token Allocation </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For users of Ask Sage, tokens are allocated based on their subscription plan and can be used for various platform features, such as training models and making inferences. There are two main categories of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inference Tokens\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Used to make predictions or inferences using the models available on the platform.\n",
    "   - **Consumption**: These tokens are consumed when users submit prompts or interact with the models in any way that requires processing text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Training Tokens\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Used to create training datasets in the Ask Sage platform.\n",
    "   - **Consumption**: These tokens are consumed when users upload data to a dataset for training purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference the following link for more information on Ask Sage tokens: https://docs.asksage.ai/docs/asksage-platform/%20asksage-tokens.html\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Token Replenishment <b> \n",

    "## 8. File Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The `file` endpoint is designed for extracting information from files, enabling seamless ingestion into Ask Sage. Below is a detailed overview of its functionality, parameters, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- **`file_path` (str)**:  \n",
    "  Specifies the path to the file you want to upload. This should be a string representing the full file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`strategy` (str, optional)**:  \n",
    "  Defines the parsing strategy to be used. Available options include:  \n",
    "  - `'auto'`: Default strategy that automatically selects the optimal parsing method.  \n",
    "  - `'fast'`: A quicker parsing method that may trade off some accuracy.  \n",
    "  - `'hi_res'`: A slower, high-accuracy method using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), ideal for image-based files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns:\n",
    "The method returns a dictionary containing:\n",
    "- **`status`**: Indicates the success or failure of the operation.\n",
    "- **`data`**: Includes any extracted information from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "The `file` endpoint is highly versatile for parsing and extracting text from various file types, such as PDFs, images, and documents. The extracted text can then be utilized in other endpoints, such as:\n",
    "- **`query_with_file`**: For querying extracted content.\n",
    "- **`train_with_file`**: For training datasets using the extracted content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This endpoint is particularly useful when working with Ask Sage **Plugins/Agents** to automate workflows involving file ingestion and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Notes:\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion**:  \n",
    "   The `file` endpoint is integral to ingesting data into Ask Sage. For example, you can parse a file and use the `Train` endpoint to assign its content to a dataset within Ask Sage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supported File Types**:  \n",
    "   Ask Sage supports a variety of file types. For a complete list, refer to the [Ask Sage Documentation](https://docs.asksage.ai/) or check directly within the Ask Sage platform. If you encounter issues with unsupported file types, contact Ask Sage support for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Image & Audio Files**:  \n",
    "   The `file` endpoint can also handle image and audio files, however when processing these files users will be charged for the inference tokens used to extract context from them. Therefore, image and audio files are more expensive to process than text files since they require inference tokens to extract the context from them.\n",

As we pre-train larger models, full ﬁne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying indepen- dent instances of ﬁne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre- trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa- rameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B ﬁne-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than ﬁne- tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav- ing fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deﬁciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efﬁcacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMany applications in natural language processing rely on adapt- ing one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down- stream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via ﬁne-tuning, which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma- jor downside of ﬁne-tuning is that the new model contains as many parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained every few months, this changes from a mere “inconvenience” for GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175 billion trainable parameters.1\\n𝑑\\n𝐴=𝒩(0,𝜎2)\\nh\\nx\\n𝐵=0\\nf(x)\\nPretrained Weights𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nx\\nPretrained Weights𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\n𝑑\\n𝑟\\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need to store and load a small number of task-speciﬁc parameters in ad- dition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the operational efﬁciency when deployed. However, existing techniques\\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza- tion. We only train A and B.\\n∗Equal contribution. 0Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency. 1While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, ﬁne-tuning boosts its perfor-\\nmance signiﬁcantly as shown in Appendix A.\\n1\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 2}}\\noften introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017) by extending model depth or reduce the model’s usable sequence length (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Ham- bardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to match the ﬁne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efﬁciency and model quality.\\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure 1 can be one or two) sufﬁces even when the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efﬁcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\nA pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif- ferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efﬁciently switch tasks by replacing the matrices A and B in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over- head signiﬁcantly.\\nLoRA makes training more efﬁcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3 times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices.\\nOur simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights when deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully ﬁne-tuned model, by construction.\\nLoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such as preﬁx-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\\nTerminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture and use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di- mension size of a Transformer layer dmodel. We use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the query/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre- trained weight matrix and ∆W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to denote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model optimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 × dmodel.\\n2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat- ing use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the maximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speciﬁc prompt.\\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x) parametrized by Φ. For instance, PΦ(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown et al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this pre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is represented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z = {(xi,yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xi and yi are sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, xi is a natural language query and yi its corresponding SQL command; for summarization, xi is the content of an article and yi its summary.\\n2\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 3}}\\nDuring full ﬁne-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights Φ0 and updated to Φ0 + ∆Φ by repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:\\nmax Φ\\n(cid:88)\\n(x,y)∈Z\\n|y| (cid:88)\\nt=1\\nlog(PΦ(yt|x,y<t))\\nOne of the main drawbacks for full ﬁne-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different set of parameters ∆Φ whose dimension |∆Φ| equals |Φ0|. Thus, if the pre-trained model is large (such as GPT-3 with |Φ0| ≈ 175 Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of ﬁne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efﬁcient approach, where the task-speciﬁc parameter increment ∆Φ = ∆Φ(Θ) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters Θ with |Θ| (cid:28) |Φ0|. The task of ﬁnding ∆Φ thus becomes optimizing over Θ:\\nmax Θ\\n(cid:88)\\n(x,y)∈Z\\n|y| (cid:88)\\nt=1\\nlog(cid:0)pΦ0+∆Φ(Θ)(yt|x,y<t)(cid:1)\\nIn the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode ∆Φ that is both compute- and memory-efﬁcient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train- able parameters |Θ| can be as small as 0.01% of |Φ0|.\\n3 AREN’T EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?\\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec- tion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there are two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms of the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and latency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus on the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block and a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit- ing multi-task settings (R¨uckl´e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed to have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di- mension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep- ikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as AllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempliﬁed by preﬁx tuning (Li & Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preﬁx tuning is difﬁcult to optimize and that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conﬁrming similar observations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for adaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which we suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study on task performance to Section 5.\\n3\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 4}}\\nBatch Size Sequence Length |Θ|\\n32 512 0.5M\\n16 256 11M\\n1 128 11M\\nFine-Tune/LoRA AdapterL AdapterH\\n1449.4±0.8\\n1482.0±1.0 (+2.2%) 1492.2±1.0 (+3.0%)\\n338.0±0.6\\n354.8±0.5 (+5.0%) 366.3±0.5 (+8.4%)\\n19.8±2.7\\n23.9±2.1 (+20.7%) 25.8±2.2 (+30.3%)\\nTable 1: Infernece latency of a single forward pass in GPT-2 medium measured in milliseconds, av- eraged over 100 trials. We use an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000. “|Θ|” denotes the number of trainable parameters in adapter layers. AdapterL and AdapterH are two variants of adapter tuning, which we describe in Section 5.1. The inference latency introduced by adapter layers can be signiﬁcant in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. See the full study in Appendix B.\\n4 OUR METHOD\\nWe describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical beneﬁts. The principles outlined here apply to any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer language models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\\n4.1 LOW-RANK-PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight matrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speciﬁc task, Aghajanyan et al. (2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low “instrisic dimension” and can still learn efﬁciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe- size the updates to the weights also have a low “intrinsic rank” during adaptation. For a pre-trained weight matrix W0 ∈ Rd×k, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de- composition W0 + ∆W = W0 + BA, where B ∈ Rd×r,A ∈ Rr×k, and the rank r (cid:28) min(d,k). During training, W0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while A and B contain trainable parameters. Note both W0 and ∆W = BA are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h = W0x, our modiﬁed forward pass yields:\\nh = W0x + ∆Wx = W0x + BAx\\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for A and zero for B, so ∆W = BA is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ∆Wx by α r , where α is a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning α is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the ﬁrst r we try and do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary r (Yang & Hu, 2021).\\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of ﬁne-tuning allows the training of a subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu- lated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressive- ness of full ﬁne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank r to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In other words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges to training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preﬁx-based methods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\\nNo Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and store W = W0 + BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0 and BA are in Rd×k. When we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0 by subtracting BA and then adding a different B(cid:48)A(cid:48), a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this\\n2They represent a negligible number of parameters compared to weights. 3An inevitability when adapting to hard tasks.\\n4\\n(3)\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 5}}\\nguarantees that we do not introduce any additional latency during inference compared to a ﬁne-tuned model by construction.\\n4.2 APPLYING LORA TO TRANSFORMER\\nIn principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in the self-attention module (Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq (or Wk, Wv) as a single matrix of dimension dmodel ×dmodel, even though the output dimension is usually sliced into attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream tasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity and parameter-efﬁciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight matrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP layers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\\nPractical Beneﬁts and Limitations. The most signiﬁcant beneﬁt comes from the reduction in memory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to 2/3 if r (cid:28) dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to 350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly 10,000× (from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with signiﬁ- cantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneﬁt is that we can switch between tasks while deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the parameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out on the ﬂy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full ﬁne-tuning5 as we do not need to calculate the gradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks with different A and B in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb A and B into W to eliminate additional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose the LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\\n5 EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De- BERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown et al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding (NLU) to generation (NLG). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark for RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com- parison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for more details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\\n5.1 BASELINES\\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their reported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear in certain experiments.\\nFine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During ﬁne-tuning, the model is initialized to the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple variant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported in prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers (FTTop2).\\n4We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires\\n350GB + 35MB * 100 ≈ 354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB ≈ 35TB.\\n5For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full ﬁne-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same\\nnumber of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\\n5\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 6}}\\nModel & Method # Trainable\\nParameters MNLI SST-2 MRPC CoLA QNLI QQP\\nRTE\\nSTS-B Avg.\\nRoBbase (FT)* RoBbase (BitFit)* RoBbase (AdptD)* RoBbase (AdptD)* RoBbase (LoRA)\\n125.0M 87.6 86.4 0.1M 84.7 85.2 0.3M 87.1±.0 94.2±.1 88.5±1.1 60.8±.4 93.1±.1 90.2±.0 71.5±2.7 89.7±.3 84.4 0.9M 87.3±.1 94.7±.3 88.4±.1 62.6±.9 93.0±.2 90.6±.0 75.9±2.2 90.3±.1 85.4 0.3M 87.5±.3 95.1±.2 89.7±.7 63.4±1.2 93.3±.3 90.8±.1 86.6±.7 91.5±.2 87.2\\n94.8 93.7\\n90.2 92.7\\n63.6 62.0\\n92.8 91.8\\n91.9 84.0\\n78.7 81.5\\n91.2 90.8\\nRoBlarge (FT)* RoBlarge (LoRA) RoBlarge (AdptP)† RoBlarge (AdptP)† RoBlarge (AdptH)† RoBlarge (AdptH)† RoBlarge (LoRA)†\\n355.0M 90.2\\n88.9 0.8M 90.6±.2 96.2±.5 90.9±1.2 68.2±1.9 94.9±.3 91.6±.1 87.4±2.5 92.6±.2 89.0\\n96.4\\n90.9\\n68.0\\n94.7\\n92.2\\n86.6\\n92.4\\n3.0M 90.2±.3 96.1±.3 90.2±.7 68.3±1.0 94.8±.2 91.9±.1 83.8±2.9 92.1±.7 88.4 0.8M 90.5±.3 96.6±.2 89.7±1.2 67.8±2.5 94.8±.3 91.7±.2 80.1±2.9 91.9±.4 87.9 6.0M 89.9±.5 96.2±.3 88.7±2.9 66.5±4.4 94.7±.2 92.1±.1 83.4±1.1 91.0±1.7 87.8 0.8M 90.3±.3 96.3±.5 87.7±1.7 66.3±2.0 94.7±.2 91.5±.1 72.9±2.9 91.5±.5 86.4 0.8M 90.6±.2 96.2±.5 90.2±1.0 68.2±1.9 94.8±.3 91.6±.2 85.2±1.1 92.3±.5 88.6\\nDeBXXL (FT)* DeBXXL (LoRA)\\n1500.0M 91.8\\n91.1 4.7M 91.9±.2 96.9±.2 92.6±.6 72.4±1.1 96.0±.1 92.9±.1 94.9±.4 93.0±.2 91.3\\n97.2\\n92.0\\n72.0\\n96.0\\n92.7\\n93.9\\n92.9\\nTable 2: RoBERTabase, RoBERTalarge, and DeBERTaXXL with different adaptation methods on the GLUE benchmark.

(2019) for a fair comparison.\\nBias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else. Contemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).\\nPreﬁx-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These spe- cial tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model’s vocabulary. Where to place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on “preﬁxing”, which prepends such tokens to the prompt, and “inﬁxing”, which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li & Liang (2021). We use lp (resp. li) denote the number of preﬁx (resp. inﬁx) tokens. The number of trainable parameters is |Θ| = dmodel × (lp + li).\\nPreﬁx-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to preﬁx-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning the word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special tokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from pre- vious layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is |Θ| = L × dmodel × (lp + li), where L is the number of Transformer layers.\\nAdapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the self- attention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two fully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this original design AdapterH. Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a more efﬁcient design with the adapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it AdapterL. This is very similar to another deign proposed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021), which we call AdapterP. We also include another baseline call AdapterDrop (R¨uckl´e et al., 2020) which drops some adapter layers for greater efﬁciency (AdapterD). We cite numbers from prior works whenever possible to maximize the number of baselines we compare with; they are in rows with an asterisk (*) in the ﬁrst column. In all cases, we have |Θ| = ˆLAdpt×(2×dmodel×r+r+dmodel)+2× ˆLLN ×dmodel where ˆLAdpt is the number of adapter layers and ˆLLN the number of trainable LayerNorms (e.g., in AdapterL). LoRA adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices in parallel to existing weight matrices. As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only apply LoRA to Wq and Wv in most experiments for simplicity. The number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank r and the shape of the original weights: |Θ| = 2× ˆLLoRA ×dmodel ×r, where ˆLLoRA is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to.\\n6\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 7}}\\nModel & Method\\n# Trainable Parameters\\nBLEU\\nE2E NLG Challenge\\nNIST\\nMET\\nROUGE-L\\nCIDEr\\nGPT-2 M (FT)* GPT-2 M (AdapterL)* GPT-2 M (AdapterL)* GPT-2 M (AdapterH) GPT-2 M (FTTop2)* GPT-2 M (PreLayer)* GPT-2 M (LoRA)\\nGPT-2 L (FT)* GPT-2 L (AdapterL) GPT-2 L (AdapterL) GPT-2 L (PreLayer)* GPT-2 L (LoRA)\\n354.92M 0.37M 11.09M 11.09M 67.3±.6 25.19M 0.35M 0.35M 70.4±.1\\n68.2 66.3 68.9\\n68.1 69.7\\n774.03M\\n68.5\\n0.88M 69.1±.1 23.00M 68.9±.3 0.77M 0.77M 70.4±.1\\n70.3\\n8.62 8.41 8.71 8.50±.07 8.59 8.81 8.85±.02 8.78 8.68±.03 8.70±.04 8.85 8.89±.02\\n46.2 45.0 46.1 46.0±.2 46.0 46.1 46.8±.2 46.0 46.3±.0 46.1±.1 46.2 46.8±.2\\n71.0 69.8 71.3 70.7±.2 70.8 71.4 71.8±.1 69.9 71.4±.2 71.3±.2 71.7 72.0±.2\\n2.47 2.40 2.47 2.44±.01 2.41 2.49 2.53±.02 2.45 2.49±.0 2.45±.02 2.47 2.47±.02\\nTable 3: GPT-2 medium (M) and large (L) with different adaptation methods on the E2E NLG Challenge.

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards such as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and popular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base (125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020) and evaluate the performance of different efﬁcient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE benchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their setup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when comparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length of 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the ﬁne-tuning baseline. Runs following this more restricted setup from Houlsby et al. (2019) are labeled with †. The result is presented in Table 2 (Top Three Sections). See Section D.1 for details on the hyperparameters used.\\n5.3 DEBERTA XXL\\nDeBERTa (He et al., 2021) is a more recent variant of BERT that is trained on a much larger scale and performs very competitively on benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) and Su- perGLUE (Wang et al., 2020). We evaluate if LoRA can still match the performance of a fully ﬁne-tuned DeBERTa XXL (1.5B) on GLUE. The result is presented in Table 2 (Bottom Section). See Section D.2 for details on the hyperparameters used.\\n5.4 GPT-2 MEDIUM/LARGE\\nHaving shown that LoRA can be a competitive alternative to full ﬁne-tuning on NLU, we hope to answer if LoRA still prevails on NLG models, such as GPT-2 medium and large (Radford et al., b). We keep our setup as close as possible to Li & Liang (2021) for a direct comparison. Due to space constraint, we only present our result on E2E NLG Challenge (Table 3) in this section. See Section F.1 for results on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) and DART (Nan et al., 2020).

The results on WikiSQL have a ﬂuctuation around ±0.5%, MNLI-m around ±0.1%, and SAMSum around ±0.2/±0.2/±0.1 for the three metrics.\\n5.5 SCALING UP TO GPT-3 175B\\nAs a ﬁnal stress test for LoRA, we scale up to GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters. Due to the high training cost, we only report the typical standard deviation for a given task over random seeds, as opposed to providing one for every entry. See Section D.4 for details on the hyperparameters used.\\nAs shown in Table 4, LoRA matches or exceeds the ﬁne-tuning baseline on all three datasets. Note that not all methods beneﬁt monotonically from having more trainable parameters, as shown in Fig- ure 2. We observe a signiﬁcant performance drop when we use more than 256 special tokens for preﬁx-embedding tuning or more than 32 special tokens for preﬁx-layer tuning. This corroborates similar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon is out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distri- bution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.\\nMultiNLI-matched\\n0.90\\n0.60\\n10\\n8\\n8\\n7\\nLoRA\\nWikiSQL\\n6\\nPrefixEmbed\\n10\\n0.86\\n0.84\\nMethod\\nPrefixLayer\\n9\\n0.55\\nAdapter(H)\\n0.70\\n0.75Validation Accuracy\\n7\\n9\\n0.88\\n0.92\\nFine-Tune\\n11log10 # Trainable Parameters\\n11log10 # Trainable Parameters\\n6\\n0.65\\nFigure 2: GPT-3 175B validation accuracy vs. number of trainable parameters of several adaptation methods on WikiSQL and MNLI-matched.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence architecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan- guage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language models have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) – both are large Transformer lan-\\n8\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 9}}\\nguage models trained on a large amount of text – where ﬁne-tuning on task-speciﬁc data after pre- training on general domain data provides a signiﬁcant performance gain compared to training on task-speciﬁc data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and remains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer language model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a few additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al., 2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a model’s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking. Fine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speciﬁc task Devlin et al. (2019b); Radford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b); Collobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream performance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform ﬁne-tuning in the usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it has the same memory footprint as pre-training.\\nParameter-Efﬁcient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3). A comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially improve its parameter efﬁciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of ﬁne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable generalization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section. However, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which take up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\\nLow-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn- ing. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many deep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned neural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works even explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath et al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho- dak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works considers low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks. In theory liter- ature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the corresponding (ﬁnite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when the underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that low-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed low-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\\n7 UNDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank adaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the hardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives better interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We focus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters (up to 10,000×) without adversely affecting task performances.\\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter budget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\\n9\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 10}}\\nto maximize downstream performance? 2) Is the “optimal” adaptation matrix ∆W really rank- deﬁcient? If so, what is a good rank to use in practice? 3) What is the connection between ∆W and W? Does ∆W highly correlate with W? How large is ∆W comparing to W?\\nWe believe that our answers to question (2) and (3) shed light on the fundamental principles of using pre-trained language models for downstream tasks, which is a critical topic in NLP.\\n7.1 WHICH WEIGHT MATRICES IN TRANSFORMER SHOULD WE APPLY LORA TO?\\nGiven a limited parameter budget, which types of weights should we adapt with LoRA to obtain the best performance on downstream tasks? As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight matrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored in FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r = 8 if we adapt one type of attention weights or r = 4 if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.\\n# of Trainable Parameters = 18M\\nWeight Type Rank r\\nWq Wk Wv Wo Wq,Wk Wq,Wv Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo 4 8\\n8\\n8\\n8\\n4\\n2\\nWikiSQL (±0.5%) MultiNLI (±0.1%)\\n70.4 91.0\\n70.0 90.8\\n73.0 91.0\\n73.2 91.3\\n71.4 91.3\\n73.7 91.3\\n73.7 91.7\\nTable 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of attention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both Wq and Wv gives the best performance overall. We ﬁnd the standard deviation across random seeds to be consistent for a given dataset, which we report in the ﬁrst column.\\nNote that putting all the parameters in ∆Wq or ∆Wk results in signiﬁcantly lower performance, while adapting both Wq and Wv yields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four captures enough information in ∆W such that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than adapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.\\n7.2 WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANK r FOR LORA?\\nWe turn our attention to the effect of rank r on model performance. We adapt {Wq,Wv}, {Wq,Wk,Wv,Wc}, and just Wq for a comparison.\\nWeight Type\\nr = 1\\nr = 2\\nr = 4\\nr = 8\\nr = 64\\nWikiSQL(±0.5%)\\nMultiNLI (±0.1%)\\nWq Wq,Wv Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo Wq Wq,Wv Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo\\n68.8 73.4 74.1\\n90.7 91.3 91.2\\n69.6 73.3 73.7\\n90.9 91.4 91.7\\n70.5 73.7 74.0\\n91.1 91.3 91.7\\n70.4 73.8 74.0\\n90.7 91.6 91.5\\n70.0 73.5 73.9\\n90.7 91.4 91.4\\nTable 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank r. To our surprise, a rank as small as one sufﬁces for adapting both Wq and Wv on these datasets while training Wq alone needs a larger r. We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.\\nTable 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r (more so for {Wq,Wv} than just Wq). This suggests the update matrix ∆W could have a very small “intrinsic rank”.6 To further support this ﬁnding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by different choices of r and by different random seeds. We argue that increasing r does not cover a more meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufﬁcient.\\n6However, we do not expect a small r to work for every task or dataset. Consider the following thought experiment: if the downstream task were in a different language than the one used for pre-training, retraining the entire model (similar to LoRA with r = dmodel) could certainly outperform LoRA with a small r.\\n10\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 11}}\\nSubspace similarity between different r. Given Ar=8 and Ar=64 which are the learned adapta- tion matrices with rank r = 8 and 64 using the same pre-trained model, we perform singular value decomposition and obtain the right-singular unitary matrices UAr=8 and UAr=64.7 We hope to an- swer: how much of the subspace spanned by the top i singular vectors in UAr=8 (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 8) is contained in the subspace spanned by top j singular vectors of UAr=64 (for 1 ≤ j ≤ 64)? We mea- sure this quantity with a normalized subspace similarity based on the Grassmann distance (See Ap- pendix G for a more formal discussion)\\nφ(Ar=8,Ar=64,i,j) =\\nUj Ar=64 min(i,j)\\n||Ui(cid:62)\\nAr=8\\n||2 F\\n∈ [0,1]\\nwhere Ui\\nAr=8\\nrepresents the columns of UAr=8 corresponding to the top-i singular vectors.\\nφ(·) has a range of [0,1], where 1 represents a complete overlap of subspaces and 0 a complete separation. See Figure 3 for how φ changes as we vary i and j. We only look at the 48th layer (out of 96) due to space constraint, but the conclusion holds for other layers as well, as shown in Section H.1.\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\nWv\\nWv\\nWq\\n16121823293540465258j12345678i\\n12345678j\\n16121823293540465258j\\n0.6\\n1.0\\n0.8\\n12345678j\\n(Ar=64,Ar=8,i,j)\\nWq\\nFigure 3: Subspace similarity between column vectors of Ar=8 and Ar=64 for both ∆Wq and ∆Wv. The third and the fourth ﬁgures zoom in on the lower-left triangle in the ﬁrst two ﬁgures. The top directions in r = 8 are included in r = 64, and vice versa.\\nWe make an important observation from Figure 3.\\nDirections corresponding to the top singular vector overlap signiﬁcantly between Ar=8 and Ar=64, while others do not. Speciﬁcally, ∆Wv (resp. ∆Wq) of Ar=8 and ∆Wv (resp. ∆Wq) of Ar=64 share a subspace of dimension 1 with normalized similarity > 0.5, providing an explanation of why r = 1 performs quite well in our downstream tasks for GPT-3.\\nSince both Ar=8 and Ar=64 are learned using the same pre-trained model, Figure 3 indicates that the top singular-vector directions of Ar=8 and Ar=64 are the most useful, while other directions potentially contain mostly random noises accumulated during training. Hence, the adaptation matrix can indeed have a very low rank.\\nSubspace similarity between different random seeds. We further conﬁrm this by plotting the normalized subspace similarity between two randomly seeded runs with r = 64, shown in Figure 4. ∆Wq appears to have a higher “intrinsic rank” than ∆Wv, since more common singular value direc- tions are learned by both runs for ∆Wq, which is in line with our empirical observation in Table 6. As a comparison, we also plot two random Gaussian matrices, which do not share any common singular value directions with each other.\\n7.3 HOW DOES THE ADAPTATION MATRIX ∆W COMPARE TO W?\\nWe further investigate the relationship between ∆W and W. In particular, does ∆W highly correlate with W? (Or mathematically, is ∆W mostly contained in the top singular directions of W?) Also,\\n7Note that a similar analysis can be carried out with B and the left-singular unitary matrices – we stick with\\nA for our experiments.\\n11\\n(4)\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 12}}\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n151015202530343944495459j\\n0.4\\n151015202530343944495459j18162432404856i\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.5\\nWq\\n(Ar=64,A0r=64,i,j)\\n151015202530343944495459j\\nRandom Gaussian\\nWv\\nFigure 4: Left and Middle: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=64 from two random seeds, for both ∆Wq and ∆Wv in the 48-th layer.

This can shed light on the underlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.\\nTo answer these questions, we project W onto the r-dimensional subspace of ∆W by comput- ing U(cid:62)WV (cid:62), with U/V being the left/right singular-vector matrix of ∆W. Then, we com- pare the Frobenius norm between (cid:107)U(cid:62)WV (cid:62)(cid:107)F and (cid:107)W(cid:107)F. As a comparison, we also compute (cid:107)U(cid:62)WV (cid:62)(cid:107)F by replacing U,V with the top r singular vectors of W or a random matrix.\\nr = 4\\nr = 64\\n∆Wq Wq\\nRandom ∆Wq Wq\\nRandom\\n||U(cid:62)WqV (cid:62)||F = 0.32 ||Wq||F = 61.95\\n21.67\\n0.02\\n||∆Wq||F = 6.91\\n1.90\\n37.71\\n0.33\\n||∆Wq||F = 3.57\\nTable 7: The Frobenius norm of U(cid:62)WqV (cid:62) where U and V are the left/right top r singular vector directions of either (1) ∆Wq, (2) Wq, or (3) a random matrix. The weight matrices are taken from the 48th layer of GPT-3.\\nWe draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, ∆W has a stronger correlation with W compared to a random matrix, indicating that ∆W ampliﬁes some features that are already in W. Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of W, ∆W only ampliﬁes directions that are not emphasized in W. Third, the ampliﬁcation factor is rather huge: 21.5 ≈ 6.91/0.32 for r = 4. See Section H.4 for why r = 64 has a smaller ampliﬁcation factor. We also provide a visualization in Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from Wq. This suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampliﬁes the important features for speciﬁc downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model.\\n8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required and the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose LoRA, an efﬁcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input sequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused on Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural networks with dense layers.\\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efﬁcient adapta- tion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind ﬁne-tuning or LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well on downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full ﬁne-\\n12\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 13}}\\ntuning. 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are there more principled ways to do it? 4) Finally, the rank-deﬁciency of ∆W suggests that W could be rank-deﬁcient as well, which can also be a source of inspiration for future works.\\nREFERENCES\\nArmen Aghajanyan, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta.\\nIntrinsic Dimensionality Explains the Effectiveness of Language Model Fine-Tuning. arXiv:2012.13255 [cs], December 2020.

However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training examples for performance-sensitive applications. As shown in Table 8, ﬁne-tuning improves the model performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take the GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020). For MNLI-matched, we use two demonstrations per class and six in-context examples in total.\\n16\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 17}}\\nMethod\\nMNLI-m (Val.

Consequently, adapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional latency. While as pointed out in R¨uckl´e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can be mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the hardware parallelism. We conﬁrm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium and point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where the added latency can be signiﬁcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging over 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension r. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH, and a recent, more efﬁcient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1 for more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter baseline in Figure 5.\\n12481632Batch Size010100250AdapterL r\\n10\\n010100250AdapterH r\\n0\\n25\\n12481632Batch Size\\n5\\n35\\n15\\n12481632Batch Size\\n30\\n20\\nSeq Len = 256\\nSeq Len = 128\\nSeq Len = 512\\nFigure 5: Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter (r = 0) baseline. The top row shows the result for AdapterH and the bottom row AdapterL. Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30% in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. We tweak the colormap for better visibility.\\nC DATASET DETAILS\\nGLUE Benchmark is a wide-ranging collection of natural language understanding tasks. It includes MNLI (inference, Williams et al. (2018)), SST-2 (sentiment analysis, Socher et al. (2013)), MRPC (paraphrase detection, Dolan & Brockett (2005)), CoLA (linguistic acceptability, Warstadt et al. (2018)), QNLI (inference, Rajpurkar et al. (2018)), QQP8 (question-answering), RTE (inference),\\n8https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs\\n17\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 18}}\\nand STS-B (textual similarity, Cer et al. (2017)). The broad coverage makes GLUE benchmark a standard metric to evaluate NLU models such as RoBERTa and DeBERTa. The individual datasets are released under different permissive licenses.\\nWikiSQL is introduced in Zhong et al. (2017) and contains 56,355/8,421 training/validation ex- amples. The task is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and table schemata. We encode context as x = {table schema,query} and target as y = {SQL}. The dataset is release under the BSD 3-Clause License.\\nSAMSum is introduced in Gliwa et al. (2019) and contains 14,732/819 training/test examples. It consists of staged chat conversations between two people and corresponding abstractive summaries written by linguists. We encode context as ”\\\\n” concatenated utterances followed by a ”\\\\n\\\\n”, and target as y = {summary}. The dataset is released under the non-commercial licence: Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0.\\nE2E NLG Challenge was ﬁrst introduced in Novikova et al. (2017) as a dataset for training end-to- end, data-driven natural language generation systems and is commonly used for data-to-text evalua- tion. The E2E dataset consists of roughly 42,000 training, 4,600 validation, and 4,600 test exam- ples from the restaurant domain. Each source table used as input can have multiple references. Each sample input (x,y) consists of a sequence of slot-value pairs, along with a corresponding natural language reference text. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.\\nDART is an open-domain data-to-text dataset described in Nan et al. (2020). DART inputs are structured as sequences of ENTITY — RELATION — ENTITY triples. With 82K examples in total, DART is a signiﬁcantly larger and more complex data-to-text task compared to E2E. The dataset is released under the MIT license.\\nWebNLG is another commonly used dataset for data-to-text evaluation (Gardent et al., 2017). With 22K examples in total WebNLG comprises 14 distinct categories, nine of which are seen during training. Since ﬁve of the 14 total categories are not seen during training, but are represented in the test set, evaluation is typically broken out by “seen” categories (S), “unseen” categories (U) and “all” (A). Each input example is represented by a sequence of SUBJECT — PROPERTY — OBJECT triples. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.\\nD HYPERPARAMETERS USED IN EXPERIMENTS\\nD.1 ROBERTA\\nWe train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. We sweep learning rate, number of training epochs, and batch size for LoRA. Following Liu et al. (2019), we initialize the LoRA modules to our best MNLI checkpoint when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of the usual initialization; the pre-trained model stays frozen for all tasks. We report the median over 5 random seeds; the result for each run is taken from the best epoch. For a fair comparison with the setup in Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021), we restrict the model sequence length to 128 and used a ﬁxed batch size for all tasks. Importantly, we start with the pre-trained RoBERTa large model when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of a model already adapted to MNLI. The runs with this restricted setup are marked with †. See the hyperparameters used in our runs in Table 9.\\nD.2 DEBERTA\\nWe again train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. Following He et al. (2021), we tune learning rate, dropout probability, warm-up steps, and batch size. We use the same model sequence length used by (He et al., 2021) to keep our comparison fair. Following He et al.

We tune learning rate for all method-dataset combinations. See Section D.4 for more details on the hyperparameters used. For preﬁx-embedding tuning, we ﬁnd the optimal lp and li to be 256 and 8, respectively, totalling 3.2M trainable parameters. We use lp = 8 and li = 8 for preﬁx-layer tuning with 20.2M trainable parameters to obtain the overall best performance. We present two parameter budgets for LoRA: 4.7M (rq = rv = 1 or rv = 2) and 37.7M (rq = rv = 8 or rq = rk = rv = ro = 2). We report the best validation performance from each run. The training hyperparameters used in our GPT-3 experiments are listed in Table 12.\\nE COMBINING LORA WITH PREFIX TUNING\\nLoRA can be naturally combined with existing preﬁx-based approaches. In this section, we evaluate two combinations of LoRA and variants of preﬁx-tuning on WikiSQL and MNLI.\\nLoRA+PreﬁxEmbed (LoRA+PE) combines LoRA with preﬁx-embedding tuning, where we insert lp + li special tokens whose embeddings are treated as trainable parameters. For more on preﬁx- embedding tuning, see Section 5.1.\\nLoRA+PreﬁxLayer (LoRA+PL) combines LoRA with preﬁx-layer tuning. We also insert lp + li special tokens; however, instead of letting the hidden representations of these tokens evolve natu-\\n20\\nSTS-B\\n4 10 2E-04 0.1 0.2\\n128\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 21}}\\nHyperparameters\\nFine-Tune\\nPreEmbed\\nPreLayer\\nBitFit\\nAdapterH\\nLoRA\\nOptimizer Batch Size # Epoch Warmup Tokens LR Schedule\\nAdamW 128 2 250,000 Linear\\nLearning Rate\\n5.00E-06\\n5.00E-04\\n1.00E-04\\n1.6E-03\\n1.00E-04\\n2.00E-04\\nTable 12: The training hyperparameters used for different GPT-3 adaption methods. We use the same hyperparameters for all datasets after tuning learning rate.\\nrally, we replace them after every Transformer block with an input agnostic vector. Thus, both the embeddings and subsequent Transformer block activations are treated as trainable parameters. For more on preﬁx-layer tuning, see Section 5.1.\\nIn Table 15, we show the evaluation results of LoRA+PE and LoRA+PL on WikiSQL and MultiNLI. First of all, LoRA+PE signiﬁcantly outperforms both LoRA and preﬁx-embedding tuning on WikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to preﬁx-embedding tuning. On MultiNLI, the combination of LoRA+PE doesn’t perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA on its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice that LoRA+PL performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters. We at- tribute this to the fact that preﬁx-layer tuning is very sensitive to the choice of learning rate and thus makes the optimization of LoRA weights more difﬁcult in LoRA+PL.\\nF ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nF.1 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-2\\nWe also repeat our experiment on DART (Nan et al., 2020) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) following the setup of Li & Liang (2021). The result is shown in Table 13. Similar to our result on E2E NLG Challenge, reported in Section 5, LoRA performs better than or at least on-par with preﬁx-based approaches given the same number of trainable parameters.\\nMethod\\n# Trainable Parameters BLEU↑ MET↑ TER↓\\nDART\\nFine-Tune AdapterL AdapterL FTTop2 PrefLayer LoRA\\nGPT-2 Medium 46.2 42.4 45.2 41.0 46.4 47.1±.2\\n354M 0.37M 11M 24M 0.35M 0.35M\\n0.39 0.36 0.38 0.34 0.38 0.39\\n0.46 0.48 0.46 0.56 0.46 0.46\\nFine-Tune AdapterL AdapterL PrefLayer LoRA\\nGPT-2 Large 47.0 45.7±.1 47.1±.1 46.7 47.5±.1\\n774M 0.88M 23M 0.77M 0.77M\\n0.39 0.38 0.39 0.38 0.39\\n0.46 0.46 0.45 0.45 0.45\\nTable 13: GPT-2 with different adaptation methods on DART.

The focus is on identifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\\nF.3 LOW-DATA REGIME\\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly sample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data MNLI-n tasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI- n. To our surprise, PreﬁxEmbed and PreﬁxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with PreﬁxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PreﬁxLayer performs better than PreﬁxEmbed but is still signiﬁcantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI- 100. The gap between preﬁx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in- crease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preﬁx-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than ﬁne-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the (±0.3) variance due to random seeds.\\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta- ble 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PreﬁxLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does not decrease with a larger learning rate.\\nG MEASURING SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBSPACES\\nB) = (cid:107)Ui(cid:62) A ∈ Rd×i and Uj\\nA UB(cid:107)2 F min{i,j}\\nA,Uj In this paper we use the measure φ(A,B,i,j) = ψ(Ui to measure the subspace B ∈ Rd×j, obtained by similarity between two column orthonormal matrices Ui taking columns of the left singular matrices of A and B.

Using the E2E NLG Challenge dataset as an example, we report the validation loss and test metrics achieved by different choices of r after training for 26,000 steps. We present our result in Table 18. The optimal rank for GPT-2 Medium is between 4 and 16 depending on the metric used, which is similar to that for GPT-3 175B. Note that the relationship between model size and the optimal rank for adaptation is still an open question.\\nH.3 CORRELATION BETWEEN W AND ∆W\\nSee Figure 8 for the normalized subspace similarity between W and ∆W with varying r.\\nNote again that ∆W does not contain the top singular directions of W, since the similarity between the top 4 directions in ∆W and the top-10% of those in W barely exceeds 0.2. This gives evidence that ∆W contains those “task-speciﬁc” directions that are otherwise not emphasized in W.\\nAn interesting next question to answer, is how “strong” do we need to amplify those task-speciﬁc directions, in order for the model adaptation to work well?\\n24\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 25}}\\n0.6\\nWq\\n0.0\\n0.8\\nWv\\n12345678j\\nWq\\nWv\\n12345678Layer 64i\\n12345678Layer 32i\\n12345678j\\n0.2\\n1.0\\n16121823293540465258j12345678Layer 96i\\n0.4\\n12345678Layer 1i\\n(Ar=8,Ar=64,i,j)\\n16121823293540465258j\\nFigure 6: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=8 and Ar=64 for both ∆Wq and ∆Wv from the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Transformer.\\nH.4 AMPLIFICATION FACTOR\\n(cid:107)∆W(cid:107)F (cid:107)U(cid:62)WV (cid:62)(cid:107)F\\nOne can naturally consider a feature ampliﬁcation factor as the ratio , where U and V are the left- and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of ∆W. (Recall UU(cid:62)WV (cid:62)V gives the “projection” of W onto the subspace spanned by ∆W.)\\nIntuitively, when ∆W mostly contains task-speciﬁc directions, this quantity measures how much of them are ampliﬁed by ∆W. As shown in Section 7.3, for r = 4, this ampliﬁcation factor is as large as 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the entire feature space from the pre-trained model W), that need to be ampliﬁed by a very large factor 20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream speciﬁc task. And, one should expect a very different set of feature directions to be ampliﬁed for each different downstream task.\\nOne may notice, however, for r = 64, this ampliﬁcation factor is only around 2, meaning that most directions learned in ∆W with r = 64 are not being ampliﬁed by much. This should not be surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent the “task-speciﬁc directions” (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the rank-4 version of ∆W (corresponding to r = 4) are ampliﬁed by a much larger factor 20.\\n25\\n\\n{\"asksage_metadata\": {\"filename\": \"LORA- LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.pdf\", \"page_number\": 26}}\\n0.5\\n17131925313743495561Layer 1i\\n0.8\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n161116212631364146515661j\\nWq\\n161116212631364146515661jLayer 96\\n161116212631364146515661j17131925313743495561Layer 64i\\nWv\\nLayer 32\\n0.0\\n0.3\\n(Ar=64,A0r=64,i,j)\\nWv\\n0.6\\n161116212631364146515661j\\nWq\\n0.7\\nFigure 7: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=64 from two randomly seeded runs, for both ∆Wq and ∆Wv from the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Trans- former.\\nRank r\\nval loss BLEU NIST METEOR ROUGE L CIDEr\\n1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024\\n1.23 1.21 1.18 1.17 1.16 1.16 1.16 1.16 1.16 1.16 1.17\\n68.72 69.17 70.38 69.57 69.61 69.33 69.24 68.73 68.92 68.78 69.37\\n8.7215 8.7413 8.8439 8.7457 8.7483 8.7736 8.7174 8.6718 8.6982 8.6857 8.7495\\n0.4565 0.4590 0.4689 0.4636 0.4629 0.4642 0.4651 0.4628 0.4629 0.4637 0.4659\\n0.7052 0.7052 0.7186 0.7196 0.7177 0.7105 0.7180 0.7127 0.7128 0.7128 0.7149\\n2.4329 2.4639 2.5349 2.5196 2.4985 2.5255 2.5070 2.5030 2.5012 2.5025 2.5090\\nTable 18: Validation loss and test set metrics on E2E NLG Challenge achieved by LoRA with different rank r using GPT-2 Medium.

       " 'response': 'Ingesting the following content: To solder effectively, start by preparing your workspace in a clean, well-lit area on a non-flammable surface. Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder.\\nThank you, I have learned this content (265 tokens).',\n",

       " 'response': 'Ingesting the following content: Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), that runs on your computer. You use the IDE to write and upload computer code to the physical board. The platform is designed to enable users of all ages to create interactive electronic objects and projects that can sense and control physical devices. Arduino boards can read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. Arduino is widely used in robotics, home automation, scientific experimentation, and artistic projects.\\nThank you, I have learned this content (174 tokens).',\n",

    "    (\"Soldering Instructions\", \"\"\"To solder effectively, start by preparing your workspace in a clean, well-lit area on a non-flammable surface. Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder.\"\"\"),\n",

    "    (\"Arduino Microcontroller Information\", \"\"\"Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), that runs on your computer. You use the IDE to write and upload computer code to the physical board. The platform is designed to enable users of all ages to create interactive electronic objects and projects that can sense and control physical devices. Arduino boards can read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. Arduino is widely used in robotics, home automation, scientific experimentation, and artistic projects.\"\"\"),\n",

      "\n",
      "A soldering iron is a hand-held tool used to melt solder, which is a fusible metal alloy, to join together electronic components on a circuit board. The soldering iron typically consists of a metal tip that heats up when electricity passes through it, allowing the user to apply heat to the solder and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Use a Soldering Iron with Microcontrollers\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Materials**: \n",
      "   - Soldering iron\n",
      "   - Solder (usually a tin-lead or lead-free alloy)\n",
      "   - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)\n",
      "   - Circuit board or breadboard\n",
      "   - Wire cutters/strippers\n",
      "   - Safety glasses\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Workspace**: \n",
      "   - Ensure you have a clean, well-lit area to work in.\n",
      "   - Use a soldering mat or a heat-resistant surface to protect your workspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat the Soldering Iron**: \n",
      "   - Plug in the soldering iron and allow it to heat up for a few minutes. Most soldering irons have a temperature range of 350°C to 400°C (662°F to 752°F).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Insert Components**: \n",
      "   - Place the microcontroller and any other components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) onto the circuit board. Ensure they are oriented correctly according to the circuit design.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Soldering Process**:\n",
      "   - **Tin the Tip**: Before soldering, apply a small amount of solder to the tip of the soldering iron to improve heat transfer.\n",
      "   - **Heat the Joint**: Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the component lead meets the circuit board pad. Hold it there for a second or two to heat both the lead and the pad.\n",
      "   - **Apply Solder**: Feed solder into the joint while keeping the soldering iron in place. The solder should flow around the lead and pad, creating a solid connection.\n",
      "   - **Remove the Iron**: Take away the soldering iron and allow the joint to cool for a few seconds. The solder should solidify, forming a strong bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Inspect the Joint**: \n",
      "   - Check the solder joint for a shiny, smooth appearance. A good solder joint should have a \"volcano\" shape and should not be dull or have cracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Clean Up**: \n",
      "   - Turn off the soldering iron and clean the tip with a damp sponge or brass sponge to remove any residual solder. Dispose of any waste materials properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Safety Tips\n",
      "- Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from solder splashes.\n",
      "- Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes from the solder.\n",
      "- Be cautious of the hot soldering iron to prevent burns.\n",

      "**Steps for Soldering a Microcontroller:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Preparation:**\n",
      "    *   Clean the soldering iron tip with a damp sponge. A clean tip ensures good heat transfer.\n",
      "    *   Tin the tip: Apply a small amount of solder to the tip to create a thin, shiny coating. This helps with heat transfer to the components [6].\n",
      "    *   Prepare the components: Make sure the component leads are clean and straight.\n",
      "    *   Secure the components: Place the microcontroller and other components on the PCB, ensuring the leads pass through the appropriate holes. Use helping hands or tape to hold them in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Soldering:**\n",
      "    *   Heat the pad and lead: Touch the soldering iron tip to both the component lead and the copper pad on the PCB simultaneously. Heat them for a few seconds.\n",
      "    *   Apply solder: Bring the solder to the joint where the lead and pad meet. The heat from the iron will melt the solder, and it should flow smoothly around the lead and onto the pad.\n",
      "    *   Remove solder and iron: Once enough solder has flowed to create a good connection (a small, shiny fillet), remove the solder first, then the soldering iron.\n",
      "    *   Let the joint cool: Allow the solder joint to cool undisturbed. This is crucial for a strong, reliable connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Inspection:**\n",
      "    *   Visually inspect the solder joint. A good solder joint should be shiny, smooth, and have a concave shape. Avoid cold solder joints (dull, grainy), which indicate a poor connection [7].\n",
      "    *   Remove excess lead: Clip any excess component lead extending beyond the solder joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Temperature Control:** Use the correct temperature setting on your soldering iron. Too low, and the solder won't melt properly; too high, and you can damage components or the PCB [8].\n",
      "*   **Cleanliness:** Keep the soldering iron tip clean and the components free of dirt and oxidation.\n",
      "*   **Practice:** Soldering takes practice. Start with simple projects to develop your skills.\n",
      "*   **Ventilation:** Solder fumes can be harmful. Work in a well-ventilated area.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Safety Precautions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes.\n",
      "*   Be careful when handling a hot soldering iron.\n",
      "*   Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling solder fumes.\n",
      "*   Wash your hands after soldering, especially if using lead-based solder.\n",

      "\n",
      "A soldering iron is a hand-held tool used to melt solder, which is a fusible metal alloy, to join together electronic components on a circuit board. The soldering iron typically consists of a metal tip that heats up when electricity passes through it, allowing the user to apply heat to the solder and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Use a Soldering Iron with Microcontrollers\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Materials**: \n",
      "   - Soldering iron\n",
      "   - Solder (usually a tin-lead or lead-free alloy)\n",
      "   - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)\n",
      "   - Circuit board or breadboard\n",
      "   - Wire cutters/strippers\n",
      "   - Safety glasses\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Workspace**: \n",
      "   - Ensure you have a clean, well-lit area to work in.\n",
      "   - Use a soldering mat or a heat-resistant surface to protect your workspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat the Soldering Iron**: \n",
      "   - Plug in the soldering iron and allow it to heat up for a few minutes. Most soldering irons have a temperature range of 350°C to 400°C (662°F to 752°F).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Insert Components**: \n",
      "   - Place the microcontroller and any other components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) onto the circuit board. Ensure they are oriented correctly according to the circuit design.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Soldering Process**:\n",
      "   - **Tin the Tip**: Before soldering, apply a small amount of solder to the tip of the soldering iron to improve heat transfer.\n",
      "   - **Heat the Joint**: Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the component lead meets the circuit board pad. Hold it there for a second or two to heat both the lead and the pad.\n",
      "   - **Apply Solder**: Feed solder into the joint while keeping the soldering iron in place. The solder should flow around the lead and pad, creating a solid connection.\n",
      "   - **Remove the Iron**: Take away the soldering iron and allow the joint to cool for a few seconds. The solder should solidify, forming a strong bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Inspect the Joint**: \n",
      "   - Check the solder joint for a shiny, smooth appearance. A good solder joint should have a \"volcano\" shape and should not be dull or have cracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Clean Up**: \n",
      "   - Turn off the soldering iron and clean the tip with a damp sponge or brass sponge to remove any residual solder. Dispose of any waste materials properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Safety Tips\n",
      "- Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from solder splashes.\n",
      "- Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes from the solder.\n",
      "- Be cautious of the hot soldering iron to prevent burns.\n",

      "🔗 References: [1] To solder effectively, start by preparing your workspace in a clean, well-lit area on a non-flammable surface. Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder. - Metadata: {\"context\": \"Soldering Instructions\"}\n",

      "[7] Video Title: Learn with Nic series: What is Container Security? - Link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4awWO1sWn8 - Video Description: In DoD, we understood the importance of having reusable lego blocks that can be shared across the Department. This prevents massive waste of resources and redundant work. - We created Iron Bank, check it out by the way, it is open source and free at ironbank.dso.mil, as our container repository for hardened #containers. We partnered with open source projects and commercial companies to harden over 1,000 containers. - The beauty with containers is that they’re designed in layers. - So, we started with the bottom layer, the Operating System base image of the container. We picked the Universal base Image from Redhat which is based on RHEL8 but completely free and open source. We hardened that image by removing unnecessary bits and configuring it to be as a secure as possible using things like SELinux and various Linux settings. - Now that base image can be used as the foundation for all other images. - Then we also built images for various programming language so that each teams doesn’t have to support those. - So, for example, for Java, we built a Java base image, based on the UBI hardened image and proceeded to harden Java as much as possible. - Now, a team building a java application, can simply use our Java base image which already meets the Operating System and Java requirements for DoD. It’s inherited. - Let's have a look. - #containersecurity - Initial Context: - This video is part of the Learn with Nic series. - Tags: container, containers, docker, container security - Learn with Nic Video link is: https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4awWO1sWn8 - \n",

      "🔗 References: [1] To solder effectively, start by preparing your workspace in a clean, well-lit area on a non-flammable surface. Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder. - Metadata: {\"context\": \"Soldering Instructions\"}\n",

      "🔗 References: [1] To solder effectively, start by preparing your workspace in a clean, well-lit area on a non-flammable surface. Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder. - Metadata: {\"context\": \"Soldering Instructions\"}\n",

Gather your tools, including a soldering iron, solder (preferably rosin-core), wire cutters/strippers, safety glasses, and a damp sponge or brass sponge for cleaning the iron tip. Plug in the soldering iron and let it heat up for a few minutes, cleaning the tip with the sponge. Next, prepare the components by stripping the ends of the wires if necessary and inserting them into the PCB or holding them together. Place the tip of the soldering iron on the joint where the two pieces of metal meet, holding it there for a second or two to heat the metal. Then, feed solder into the joint (not directly onto the iron), allowing it to flow around the connection to create a good bond. After removing the iron, let the solder cool for a few seconds without moving the joint. Inspect the solder joint; it should be shiny and have a smooth, cone-like shape. If it appears dull or cracked, reheat and add more solder. Finally, turn off the soldering iron and let it cool, cleaning your workspace and disposing of any waste properly. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and be cautious of hot surfaces and molten solder. - Metadata: {\"context\": \"Soldering Instructions\"}\n",

The cat, sleek and confident, quickly noticed Toby's aversion. Curious and a bit mischievous, the cat decided to find out why Toby was so hesitant around its kind.
